Gathered a dataset that includes information on individuals' demographics, lifestyle, habits, and health records. 
Cleaned and preprocessed the data, which may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling numerical features.
Identified relevant features that may contribute to predicting smoking behavior. created new features or perform feature selection to improve model performance.
selected appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, Gaussian Naive Bayes.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.
Used appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to measure the model's performance in predicting smoking behavior.
Optimized the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
Plotted ROC Curve.
